## Overview
This repository contains a dataset comprising both real and AI-generated images. The dataset is intended for research purposes in computer vision, machine learning, and related areas. It provides a diverse collection of images to facilitate developing and evaluating of algorithms, models, and techniques. I created this dataset from 3 separate Kaggle datasets (see references below) to use as a data source for training CNNs to predict AI-generated vs Real images of the same subject: SHOES.  

## Contents
The dataset includes two main categories of images:
1. **Real Images**: Images scraped from Google Images for Nike, Adidas, and Converse shoes. The source Kaggle dataset is linked below under references.
2. **AI-Generated Images**: Images generated using MidJourney. The source Kaggle dataset is linked below under references.

All images are of dimension 240x240. The AI-generated images have been compressed and resized to the same dimensions as the Real Images. For full-resolution AI images, refer to the source dataset below under References  

## Usage
Researchers/Developers can utilize this dataset for the following purposes:
- Training and evaluating image generation models.
- Investigating the differences between real and AI-generated images.
- Image classification, object detection, and image enhancement algorithms.
- Exploring the challenges and opportunities in the synthesis of realistic images.
